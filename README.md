# Analysis of Green Energy Stocks

## Overview of Project
The project was an analysis of green stocks using data from the year 2017 and 2018.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide a real-time analysis of several green enery stocks using data from the year 2017 and 2018, and to make a user-friendly macro for users to easily access this information without having prior knowledge of VBA coding.
## Results
### Stock Performance 
### Execution Times
The original script ran at 0.734375 seconds for the Year 2017 and at 0.6796875 seconds for the Year 2018. The refactored script ran at 0.0859375 seconds for Year 2017 and Year 2018. As you can see, the refactored script runs much faster and more efficient than the original.

## Summary
The advantage of refactoring code is that you can decrease the run time of the macro and make it more efficient. This allows for quicker processing speeds. The disadvantage of refactoring code can be human error in the code that is not detected. For example, many times this script would still run without all the proper contents in the code.
